Social Media has invaded every aspects of our lives. We use Facebook to express our day to day activities,
Instagram to share pictures and twitter to share our thoughts and feelings. Whenever we read a text from
someone, we are able to figure out whether the user was angry or happy while posting it. Imagine a program
that is also able to figure out the same thing!
A Machine Learning algorithm can be trained on textual data with the help of Natural Language Processing
to analyze the sentiment behind textual data at a faster rate that humans are able to.
The Objective of our project is to train machine learning algorithms to analyze and classify the texts in
tweets as positive or negative with high accuracy.
This analysis can be used in order to gain better insights behind the thought process of the users. The
information generated can be used to achieve better customer engagement by companies. With how
influential social media has become, Analysis of feelings on the basis of what people share on social media
can change the way how businesses works.
In order to tackle this problem, we have applied Sentiment analysis which is a subset of Natural Language
Processing
